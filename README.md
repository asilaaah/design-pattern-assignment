# design-pattern-assignment

Group project to develop a Java GUI application that allows a user to decorate Sultan Abdul Samad building with Merdeka decorations such as fireworks, flag and more.
The implementation of this Java application is adapted from https://teafuelledcode.wordpress.com/2013/09/26/java-christmas-swing-project/). 
Five design patterns needed to be applied into the program to redesign the Christmas tree application.
